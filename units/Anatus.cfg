	# All the conversation events for the smiths have two versions. One cold version (before voadar spends a night drinking with them)
	# and a normal version. To control this, all the conversation event assignments have $smiths.cold_or_warm| inserted; its text will control
	# which version is assigned. 
	# Anatil's unit file contains definitions for all the cold events. All the warm ones are in here.
	# Anatil also has anything that isn't specifically cold/warm (stuff that happens no matter what)
