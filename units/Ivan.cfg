				message1=_"We used to have a danged good postal system in this Village! All thanks to that $d|Curryan,$b| the postmaster. She's the one that started the whole thing, takin' letters 'n' packages to the capital that's east of here and back. Course, soon as folks warmed up to the idea, she started having a hard time keeping up with the demand, so she had to hire an assistant. And now the whole town is in trouble, 'cause that lazy little boy $d|quit!$b|"
				message2=_"That's right! Wanted a more exciting life, so he's tryin' to work as a $d|gladiator.$b| And between you and me, he's doomed! Hasn't won a single match! Here we all are, with the economy ruined, 'cause that little squirt don't know what's good for him. Why, he don't even practice before the matches! If I was as strong as I used to be, I'd knock some sense right into him, I would!"
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"Gladiating"
				message1=_"Well, I imagine you've heard about the $d|gladiating$b| that goes on in this town by now? It's the biggest sport in the country, and all the best gladiators come here! You're lucky, it's even tournament season! There's no better place to be this time of year than here. And it's all thanks to those elves that run the arena. Tough as nails, those two!"
				message2=_"Like most elves though, they're folks of many talents. Sure, they could probably outfight anyone in the town, but they're intellectuals, too! Talk to 'em sometime when they're real relaxed... somewhere $d|outside of the village,$b| and you'll see just what I mean! "
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"Frank's secret"
				message1=_"Hee hee! Oh, here's a real juicy one! Have to keep my voice down, since he lives nearby. Hee hee! You know $d|Frank,$b| the carpenter? Well, he'd go pink like a garden flower if he heard me sayin' this! See... he's fallen in love with $d|Rachael,$b| the fisher's daughter! Hee hee!"
				message2=_"Bet she'd be interested in him too, if her mother, Juditha, wasn't such a sour-puss. Doesn't trust no one, that woman. Prob'ly the only person in the town stiff enough to get in between a perfect match like Frank and Rachael. Some folks even say she charges more at the market than Rachael does, though they both charge me 3 gold per fish."
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"The tourist boys"
				message1=_"I'll bet you've seen those tourist boys who're always practicing behind the arena. Nice fellows, remind me of my grand-kids! But they all live in the capital. My grand-kids, I mean. I'd move up there, but then I'd miss all the gladiator fights! Heh heh, betting on those is how I make half my money! Ain't nobody can out-guess me. And you know who I've been putting money on recently? Them $d|tourist boys!$b|"
				message2=_"Heh heh! That's just about what most folks say when I tell 'em. Sometimes I wonder if you can't understand me after all! Heh heh! Anyway, they might not look so strong, but that's just 'cause they don't like to act tough, unlike most of the gladiators. I bet if you saw 'em in the ring you'd be surprised! Besides, they're $d|clever,$b| too. That counts for a lot more than most folks think. Sure, they lost a lot at first, but they've been $d|improvin' every match!$b| I'm just afraid that before long the stakes will inflate for 'em... once everyone expects 'em to win, nobody will make good bets against 'em and I'll have to find a new underdog that can make me money."
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"The tavern's rooms"
				message1=_"Have you tried going into the rooms in the tavern? Well, most of 'em are for customers only! If you $d|rent a room,$b| you can go in it, of course, but other'n that the only way in is if the fellow rentin' the room lets yeh in. Course, most folks are friendly enough that they'll let ya visit whenever they're home."
				message2=_"Take them bar owners, for instance! They sleep in the east room, but if ever one of them is takin' a break in there you can bet they'll let you stop by. Fine folks, the bar owners! 'Specially that Maple! You don't see such a good lookin' lass in every village. <i>(Hushes voice)</i> And between you and me, buddy, I think she's got somethin' for me. Hee hee! Yes sir, them ladies is still crazy for old Ivan!"
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"The forest and ghosts"
				message1=_"You ever explored that spooky forest across the river? Some folks go in there all the time, but you have to be $d|careful!$b| It's thick with mosquitoes, but that's hardly the worst of it. If you're unlucky, you could run into a bear, and those things are dangerous. But them are rare enough that they shouldn't be no serious worry. It's the $d|spirits$b| you have to watch out for!"
				message2=_"Don't you believe in spirits? Well, folks in town don't call 'em that no more. We figure they ain't really the ghosts of past humans, but some other kinda spirity creature. Soullesses, we call 'em, since they don't rightly seem to be alive, but they sure aren't dead neither. Most folks say real ghosts don't exist. But once, years ago, on a midnight with no moon... ah, everyone thinks I'm just foolin' when I say this. But I could swear I saw something ghostly that night at the cemetery. Nothin' scary like a soulless, just the faintest wisp of a sad face. And maybe it was just my imagination, but the $d|big boulder$b| it was floating above seemed to give off a soft, green glow."
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"Ale and the blacksmiths"
				message1=_"Ooh, here's some inside information on the most important fellow in the town: me! You know that back in the day I could drink four mugs of ale? It's true! I tried to go higher once in a while, but kept blackin' out for some reason... But don't think I couldn't hold my alcohol! Heh heh, I'd drink four and you'd think I was dry like a hay bale!"
				message2=_"Yes, them adult beverages affect everyone different... don't affect me at all, of course, but it makes some folks real quiet and grumpy. Not dwarves though! Heh heh! Take those two $d|blacksmiths,$b| for example. The only time they ain't grumpy is when they're so drunk they can barely see! Yessir, you want to get on a dwarf's $d|good side,$b| befriend 'em while they're drunk! Heh heh! ...Wonder how ale would affect that stupid $d|mayor...$b| maybe we could find out, if he ever left that big red house of his. Course, he's such a sour-puss that he'd be a grump no matter what alcohol did to him."
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"Klippy the tramp"
				message1=_"You know who's a real bad egg? $d|Klippy,$b| the tramp. Don't believe me? Most folks don't... she's a real smooth talker, that one. Everyone seems to think she's just a poor, abused, street orphan. She's especially got the town guards in her pocket, including Harold, the grumpy one. And that's impressive! Tell you why she puts such an effort into seeming innocent, too... Really, she's a low-down $d|thief!$b|"
				message2=_"She's so sneaky about it that not even Grigar the orc notices when she steals from him! Ain't nobody can see her moving around, if she doesn't want 'em to. Maybe could even slip past me, if she cared. But I don't got nothing worth stealing, and she knows I can't convince anyone she's a crook, so I'm the one chap in the town that knows what she's really up to. Yep, I see her takin' stuff what ain't hers all the time... a while back, she walked right into the fisher's boat and stole their best $d|fishing net.$b| Everybody figures it was some tourist that left town weeks ago."
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"The other farmers"
				message1=_"You been down to see the farmers yet? Course I don't mean you an' Cadameron, I mean the other ones, $d|Vyncent$b| and them. Live South-East of town, in part of them grass-lands that stretch between here and the capital. Not the best place for a farm, I'm afraid. Nothing like your pretty little valley. Have to work day-in, day-out, just to make ends meet. "
				message2=_"Heh heh, if you ever want a good laugh, just go watch that Vyncent workin' in the canal. Nothin' he hates worse than mud, and nothin' he sees more of than it! Throws a proper tantrum if it gets 'specially bad; a real hoot to watch if you ask me. Not that I'd want to be stuck farming on a terrible plot of land like that one... 'Specially with all those crazy taxes the mayor's enforcing."
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"The old mine"
				message1=_"Much as I love Raplice, I do get tired of it once in a while. Need a little adventure now and then, you know? That's why, few years back, I wandered off to find that $d|mineshaft$b| somebody told me about. Apparently when they first settled this place they thought there was iron ore in the mountains to the $d|northwest,$b| so they set up a mining camp, most of a day's journey into the forest."
				message2=_"Rumor has it they weren't findin' as much ore as they wanted, so when they hit an underground stream they gave up. Anyway, I was thinkin' it'd be fun to explore the old mineshaft, you know? Took me a while to find the entrance, high in them plateaus. But here's the best part: even when I found it, I just wound up headin' home! Couldn't get more than a few feet into the shaft, 'cause some old fool left the place hopelessly cluttered up with minecarts! They was so big an' sturdy I couldn't even squeeze past 'em!"
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"Nhardril's past"
				message1=_"Hey, did you know that Nhardril, the co-owner of the tavern, used to be in the construction business?"
				message2=_"Says he used to work with a big dwarvish building company that worked all over the capital. Decided to quit and start a private construction business here; don't know why. Maybe had a fight with his boss or somethin'. Though that seems unlikely, he's a right friendly chap. 'Specially for a dwarf. Anyway, he built a lot of what you see here... the road, lot'a of the houses, even helped with the chapel. Finally, he got tired of it all, so his last project was makin' the inn. Partnered up with that pretty elf and has been a proud bar owner ever since!"
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"Maple and the forest"
				message1=_"You know, now and then I'll see Maple, that lovely young elf lass, headin' into the $d|forest$b| all alone. She's single, too, I might add! Hee hee! Makes a man wonder what she's up to in there. Tried to follow her once, a year or two ago, before I got too stiff to swim the river."
				message2=_"Hee hee! And I'll bet you would've done the same, if you weren't just a silly critter! Anyway, she was just too derned quick for old Ivan. Lost sight of her not far from the river-bank, I did. Still $d|wonder what she does$b| in there! ...You know, them elves is a lot older than they look. Way I figure it, she looks so young and pretty that she must really be near-about my age! Hee hee! You think these old joints could still catch a lady's eye? I knew some real elf dances back in the day... let's see, how did that one start?"
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"Leonna, Abe, and the giant spiders"
				message1=_"Hm... this one's old news, but maybe you ain't heard it yet. Heh heh! Who'm I kidding? Little critter like you don't understand nothin', course you ain't heard it yet! Lemme tell you about Nyssa and Abe. Nyssa's the little farmer girl that lives South-East of town, and Abe's the cobbler's son. They been best friends ever since the cobbler moved here a few years ago. They're young, but they ain't infants... just old enough to start fallin' in love, but not old enough yet to know it, way I figure. Heh heh! Or maybe I'm just makin' that up cause it's a good story. Can't honestly say myself."
				message2=_"Anyway... well, it's no laughing matter, really. They was settin' under a tree at the farm, when out of no-where a $d|giant spider$b| appears and grabs up little Abe. Dragged him off right in front of poor Nyssa's eyes, rumor has it. Bad as that is, it's been even worse for Leonna, Abe's mother. Used to be the best cobbler in the country, but now she just sits in her house all day, mostly cryin'. Don't figure she'll ever be herself again unless some miracle $d|brings Abe back$b| from death."
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"Nickieldur's past"
				message1=_"I've told you about them tourist boys, ain't I? Well you know some real juicy gossip I heard the other day? The elf one of 'em $d|lost his memory$b| a few years back! Ain't that something! He don't know where he came from or nothin'!"
				message2=_"Course, I don't really know the details. You seem to like listening to folks talk. Maybe he'd $d|tell you$b| about it sometime. Don't know why he would, though, seein' as you're just a silly animal that don't understand nothing anyway! I'll talk to anything that listens, but that's just me! Heh heh! Though maybe he's one of those crazies that thinks you're intelligent and all."
			[/value]
			[value]
				title=_"The Aristos"
				message1=_"I'm sure you met the town preacher by now. Father Aristo, folks call him. Gives a great sermon on Union days, though I don't know how. See, whenever he's not in the chapel, he's either in the tavern gettin' drunk or at home sleepin' it off. Even gets so drunk he tries flirtin' with Maple sometimes! Hee hee! Don't he know that's my gal? I ain't the one it really bothers, though. See, he's already got a gal, Mrs. Aristo. His wife. She's been none too happy with his habbits lately... prob'ly fixin' for a divorce, way I see it. "
				message2=_"Nothin' good comes from a family breakin' up like that! Take Robert, their son. He's as good a kid as you could find, but what with all that's goin' on between his parents, he's kinda been forgotten, 'fraid to say. Been takin' on most of his dad's duties, and ain't got a friend in the world. Know what that boy needs? A hobby! Somebody oughta give him something to take his mind off things... bet he'd make a spankin' good $d|swordsman.$b|"
