List of things to do:

## current projects' steps

## other smallish projects
all about the key
robert - sword and befriend, and item convos
main quest

## other big projects
ending scenarios
hint system
make over the gladiating arena so you have challengers that change daily and you can choose which ones to accept

## projects for (maybe distant) future releases
consequences for being caught in a place you shouldn't be (barnhouse, guardhouse, fishing-hut, inn room)
	- custom event fired from schedule; simple filter whether unit is in sight
	- change sleeping to use [end_turn] instead of killing Voadar so he can be found by filters (maybe? consider auto saves)
further balance Dogifforo fight
maybe reformat all the inventory stuff using the new image_pos
evil victory/spider fight
actual tourists
	- a shady guy, buys stuff from klippy
	- a bard (hired by tavern, maple's fish recipe)
	- the family
	- a mini-boss gladiator (only shows up after hob has been spanked) (prize: mercenary in final battle?)
body guard curryan to capital
rewrite farmers to sound uneducated
extra gladiator: poison (you should get cured after match, no matter what)
extra gladiator: the mage got gud
gladiator spectator mode
da music
fishing mini-boss (if you fish in middle of lake)
	- minions very weak to the net attack; give you 1 fish whenever you kill one
	- prize???
You can win the Dogifforo fight even if Maple dies; she's gone forever after that
buried treasure of some kind

## unimportant ideas
you can return stolen items to the owner
Nickieldur circles the arena when he can't reach you
use [micro_ai]s to make certain gladiators more reckless (higher aggression)
some kind of fetch game with Fifo using a carapace
robert gladiator fight: uses true ranged magic attacks, runs to nearest 60% defense place not adjacent to Voadar
all unit descriptions
[sound_source]s
Tourist/gladiator boys say something different when walking than when practicing

## probably more trouble than they're worth
someone calls guards if you show carapaces (if guards are in sight, otherwise just throws a tantrum)
heavy armor from the smiths; you can equip/unequip it: 80ish gold for -2MP, +10% blade&impact, +30% pierce
Dogifforo does stuff: occasional tax collection, delivering packages
allow you to stick up for Grigar when the smiths are picking on him (marked in units/Anatus.cfg)
add title deed
