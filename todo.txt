List of things to do:

## current projects' steps
everyone reacts to many items

## other smallish projects
robert - sword and befriend
raen's quiz mini-game
mrs.aristo's schedule

## other big projects
main quest
spectator mode in gladiating arena?
ending scenario

## ideas for (distant) future releases
maybe reformat all the inventory stuff using the new image_pos
evil victory/spider fight
tourists
body guard curryan to capital
an eighth "big league" gladiator: poison (you should get cured after match, no matter what)
rewrite farmers to sound uneducated

## unimportant ideas
klippy sells a document revealing something or other about the mayor
Tourist/gladiator boys say something different when walking than when practicing
Nickieldur circles the arena when he can't reach you
Improve Derek's quick attacks in the arena (improved filter, improved moveto location)
perhaps use [micro_ai]s to make certain gladiators more reckless? (higher aggression)
allow you to stick up for Grigar when the smiths are picking on him (marked in units/Anatus.cfg)
consequences for being caught in a place you shouldn't be (ie, the barnhouse, guardhouse, fishing-hut)
heavy armor from the smiths; you can equip/unequip it: 80ish gold for -2MP, +10% blade&impact, +30% pierce
maybe figure out/fix the poison issue? (for now the damage is applied manually each side turn, in scenario.cfg)
	- Maybe: instead of unhealable, just manually make all units resting=no and double check there are no healers/villages
	- but bear in mind that poison shouldn't do the whole 8 damage, the current implementation allows me to very easily choose how much it does
add title deed
all unit descriptions
