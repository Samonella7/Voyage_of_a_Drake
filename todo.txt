List of things to do:

## current projects' steps
item conversations for: Nhardril, Father Aristo, Robert, Raen
dogifforo fight & results
robert - sword and befriend

## other smallish projects
raen's quiz mini-game (cold attack?)
you can return stolen items to the owner
consequences for being caught in a place you shouldn't be (barnhouse, guardhouse, fishing-hut, inn room)
	- custom event fired from schedule; simple filter whether unit is in sight
main quest
unified tracks system? or still duplicate code. either way, add tracks images, appear in radius of moved to tile

## other big projects
spectator mode in gladiating arena?
ending scenarios
hint system

## big projects for (distant) future releases
maybe reformat all the inventory stuff using the new image_pos
evil victory/spider fight
actual tourists
	- a shady guy buys stuff from klippy
	- a bard
	- the family
	- a mini-boss gladiator (idk what prize)
body guard curryan to capital
an eighth "big league" gladiator: poison (you should get cured after match, no matter what)
rewrite farmers to sound uneducated
make over the gladiating arena so you have challengers that change daily and you can choose which ones to accept
da music
fishing mini-boss (if you fish in middle of lake)
	-minions very weak to the net attack; give you 1 fish whenever you kill one
	-change bear_claws to beast_claws or something, you get them for defeating this fellow too

## unimportant ideas
someone calls guards if you show carapaces (if guards are in sight, otherwise just throws a tantrum)
Nickieldur circles the arena when he can't reach you
use [micro_ai]s to make certain gladiators more reckless (higher aggression)
some kind of fetch game with Fifo using a carapace
robert gladiator fight: uses true ranged magic attacks, runs to nearest 60% defense place not adjacent to Voadar
all unit descriptions
[sound_source]s
Tourist/gladiator boys say something different when walking than when practicing

## probably more trouble than they're worth
heavy armor from the smiths; you can equip/unequip it: 80ish gold for -2MP, +10% blade&impact, +30% pierce
occational tax collection
allow you to stick up for Grigar when the smiths are picking on him (marked in units/Anatus.cfg)
add title deed
