List of things to do:

## current projects' steps
item conversations for: Nhardril, Father Aristo, Robert, Raen
dogifforo fight & results

## other smallish projects
robert - sword and befriend
raen's quiz mini-game (cold attack?)
you can return stolen items to the owner
consequences for being caught in a place you shouldn't be (barnhouse, guardhouse, fishing-hut, inn room)
	- custom event fired from schedule; simple filter whether unit is in sight
main quest
unified tracks system? or still duplicate code. either way, add tracks images, appear in radius of moved to tile

## other big projects
spectator mode in gladiating arena?
ending scenarios
hint system

## big projects for (distant) future releases
maybe reformat all the inventory stuff using the new image_pos
evil victory/spider fight
actual tourists
body guard curryan to capital
an eighth "big league" gladiator: poison (you should get cured after match, no matter what)
rewrite farmers to sound uneducated
make over the gladiating arena so you have challengers that change daily and you can choose which ones to accept
da music

## unimportant ideas
someone calls guards if you show carapaces (if guards are in sight, otherwise just throws a tantrum)
Nickieldur circles the arena when he can't reach you
Improve Derek's quick attacks in the arena (improved filter, improved moveto location)
perhaps use [micro_ai]s to make certain gladiators more reckless? (higher aggression)
heavy armor from the smiths; you can equip/unequip it: 80ish gold for -2MP, +10% blade&impact, +30% pierce
klippy meets with some other buyer
some kind of fetch game with Fifo using a carapace
robert gladiator fight: uses true ranged magic attacks, runs to nearest 60% defense place not adjacent to Voadar
all unit descriptions
[sound_source]s

## probably more trouble than they're worth
Tourist/gladiator boys say something different when walking than when practicing
occational tax collection
allow you to stick up for Grigar when the smiths are picking on him (marked in units/Anatus.cfg)
maybe figure out/fix the poison issue? (for now the damage is applied manually each side turn, in scenario.cfg)
	- Maybe: instead of unhealable, just manually make all units resting=no and double check there are no healers/villages
	- but bear in mind that poison shouldn't do the whole 8 damage, the current implementation allows me to very easily choose how much it does
