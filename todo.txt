List of things to do:

## current projects' steps
item conversations for: Nhardril, Robert
make the attack you earn from Raen

## other smallish projects
all about the key
robert - sword and befriend
main quest

## other big projects
ending scenarios
hint system

## projects for (distant) future releases
consequences for being caught in a place you shouldn't be (barnhouse, guardhouse, fishing-hut, inn room)
	- custom event fired from schedule; simple filter whether unit is in sight
further balance Dogifforo fight
maybe reformat all the inventory stuff using the new image_pos
evil victory/spider fight
actual tourists
	- a shady guy, buys stuff from klippy
	- a bard
	- the family
	- a mini-boss gladiator (prize: mercenary in final battle?)
body guard curryan to capital
an eighth "big league" gladiator: poison (you should get cured after match, no matter what)
ninth "big leage" gladiator: the mage got gud
rewrite farmers to sound uneducated
make over the gladiating arena so you have challengers that change daily and you can choose which ones to accept
	- then spectator mode
da music
fishing mini-boss (if you fish in middle of lake)
	-minions very weak to the net attack; give you 1 fish whenever you kill one
	-change bear_claws to beast_claws or something, you get them for defeating this fellow too
You can win the Dogifforo fight even if Maple dies; she's gone forever after that
buried treasure of some kind

## unimportant ideas
you can return stolen items to the owner
someone calls guards if you show carapaces (if guards are in sight, otherwise just throws a tantrum)
Nickieldur circles the arena when he can't reach you
use [micro_ai]s to make certain gladiators more reckless (higher aggression)
some kind of fetch game with Fifo using a carapace
robert gladiator fight: uses true ranged magic attacks, runs to nearest 60% defense place not adjacent to Voadar
all unit descriptions
[sound_source]s
Tourist/gladiator boys say something different when walking than when practicing

## probably more trouble than they're worth
heavy armor from the smiths; you can equip/unequip it: 80ish gold for -2MP, +10% blade&impact, +30% pierce
occasional tax collection
allow you to stick up for Grigar when the smiths are picking on him (marked in units/Anatus.cfg)
add title deed
